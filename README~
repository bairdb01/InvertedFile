Implementation of the Inverted File data structure in C using Binary Search Tree and Linked List. Two available modes: Online and offline.

Offline: Build the database of keywords from the datafiles and create the dictionary, posting, and docids files.

                - dictionary.txt: contains all terms in the binary search tree
                                  along with the number of documents in which they occur.
                                  Sorted alphabetically.
                    <total number of terms>
                    <term1> <document-frequency1>
                    <term2> <document-frequency2>
                      
                - postings.txt: contains the document's id and it's term frequency
                    <total number of entries>
                    <docno1> <term-frequency1>
                    <docno2> <term-frequency2>
                    
                - docids.txt: docid's with their starting positions from the input file
                    <total number of documents>
                    <docid1> <start-position1>
                    <docid2> <start-position2>

Online: Use the created files with a query to find relevant documents and return
        their titles.
